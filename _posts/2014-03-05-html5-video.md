There is a lot of documentation on HTML5 video tags, like
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML5_audio_and_video)
and [here](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/). Although the more intricate
documentation which covers most of the events associated with media type is documented
well on [whatwg.org documentation](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-video-element.html).

This post is about some of the things that we got to know while working with [video.js](http://www.videojs.com/)
JavaScript library. You can view the [demo](/pages/html5-video/) of what follows here. For complete source code
you could look in to the source code of the demo page. Although here we would highlight some of the code.

Consider that your initial video tag state is like following.
{% highlight html %}
    <video id="example_video_1" class="video-js vjs-default-skin" controls preload="none" width="320" height="180" poster="http://video-js.zencoder.com/oceans-clip.png" data-setup='{"example_option":true}'>
      <source src="http://video-js.zencoder.com/oceans-clip.mp4" type='video/mp4' />
    </video>
{% endhighlight %}
Initialize VideoJs Player

{% highlight javascript %}
    var app = {}; // Sort of namespacing
    app.p1 = _V_('example_video_1'); // reference to video tag
{% endhighlight %}

In above snippet it is expected that `example_video_1` is id reference of `video` tag.

Some of the things thats not clearly evident are

### Stop media(video or audio) download
Clear the source tag. AFAIK there is no event associated with `audio` or `video` tag which allows you to stop download
of any source associated with the tag. When pause event is fired on the element, it merely pauses the audio or video
but continues to download the associated media. To completely stop the media download, you would have to clear the `src`
attribute. In VideoJs you would do it like

{% highlight javascript %}
    app.p1.src('');
{% endhighlight %}

Note that above will make your player defunct, i.e you would not be able to play the media anymore, unless you associate
back any media source to it.

### Change Video Poster for already initialized Video.

In videojs changing poster can be done with something like below.

{% highlight javascript %}
    $(app.p1.el()).find('video').attr('poster', 'http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/poster.png');
{% endhighlight %}

### Use same video element to play different Videos like Playlist.

Assuming that your playlist JSON is something like
{% highlight javascript %}
    app.pls = [{
            title: "Ocean",
            url: "http://video-js.zencoder.com/oceans-clip.mp4",
            poster: 'http://video-js.zencoder.com/oceans-clip.png'
        }, {
            title: "Animation",
            url: "http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4",
            poster: "http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/poster.png"
        }, {
            title: 'Ted',
            url: 'http://video.ted.com/talk/podcast/2013X/None/AndresLozano_2013X-light.mp4',
            poster: 'http://images.ted.com/images/ted/a94a473fdf524014a80d4bb19a4b159543679fa4_615x461.jpg'
        }
        ];
{% endhighlight %}

We would want to iterate over the list and associate relevant events to be able to play
right media file and set relevant video poster.

{% highlight javascript %}
    app.pls.forEach(function (item) {
        var title = $('<li>').html(item.title)
            .click(function () {
            app.changeSource(item)
        });
        app.plContainer.append(title);
    });
{% endhighlight %}

On change source event

{% highlight javascript %}
    app.changeSource = function (item) {
        app.p1.pause();
        setTimeout(function () {
            app.p1.src(item.url);
            $(app.p1.el()).find('video').attr('poster', item.poster);
            setTimeout(function () {
                // Add some delay to show poster and allow previous js cycle to complete
                app.p1.play()
            }, 250);
        }, 0);
    }
{% endhighlight %}
