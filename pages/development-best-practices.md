# Coding practices in general

* Codes should reside in Version control. Example Github.
* Project should have a `README.md` containing primary information on project, 
important links and how to set up project.
* Make use of [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) for formatting source code.
  * Various plugins available.
  * There is no restriction on Editor that you use but ensure that if follows editorconfig.
* Use code linter. For example JsLint. You can set it up at project level.
* Learn [Git](https://git-scm.com/documentation).
  * Learning command line has some learning curve, but way more handy than UI.
  * Use branching in case of any confusion. Branching out in Git is cheap.
  * Proper use of .gitignore - https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
  * Don't commit library binaries along with source. For eg. DON'T commit `jar`, `node_modules`, log files etc.
